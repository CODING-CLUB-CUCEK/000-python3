## Question

```text
 Consider a list (list = []). You can perform the following commands:

insert i e: Insert integer e at position i.
print: Print the list.
remove e: Delete the first occurrence of integer e .
append e: Insert integer e at the end of the list.
sort: Sort the list.
pop: Pop the last element from the list.
reverse: Reverse the list.
Initialize your list and read in the value of  n followed by n lines of commands where each command will be of the 7 types listed above. Iterate through each command in order and perform the corresponding operation on your list.
```
# Code Explanation

The given code snippet represents a Python program that takes input commands and performs corresponding operations on a list based on those commands. Let's go through the code and understand its functionality.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    N = int(input())
    l = []
    for _ in range(N):
        cmd , *e = input().split()
```

- The program begins by checking if it is being run as the main module.
- It takes an integer `N` as input, which represents the number of commands to be processed.
- An empty list `l` is created to store the elements.

```python
        match cmd:
            case "insert":
                l.insert(int(e[0]), int(e[1]))
            case "print":
                print(l)
            case "remove":
                l.remove(int(e[0]))
            case "append":
                l.append(int(e[0]))
            case "sort":
                l.sort()
            case "pop":
                l.pop()
            case "reverse":
                l.reverse()
```

- The code then enters a loop that iterates `N` times, processing each command.
- The command is split into two parts: `cmd` (the command itself) and `e` (the elements associated with the command).
- The `match` statement is used to match the value of `cmd` and execute the corresponding code block based on the matched command.
- The available commands and their respective operations are as follows:
  - `insert`: Inserts an element into the list at the specified index.
  - `print`: Prints the current contents of the list.
  - `remove`: Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from the list.
  - `append`: Appends an element to the end of the list.
  - `sort`: Sorts the elements of the list in ascending order.
  - `pop`: Removes and returns the last element of the list.
  - `reverse`: Reverses the order of the elements in the list.

## Compatibility Note

It is important to note that this code uses the `match` statement, which was introduced in Python 3.10. Hence, it may not work with older versions of Python. If you encounter errors or compatibility issues, especially on platforms like HackerRank, it is recommended to replace the `match` statement with `if-elif` statements to achieve the same functionality.

```python
        if cmd == "insert":
            l.insert(int(e[0]), int(e[1]))
        elif cmd == "print":
            print(l)
        elif cmd == "remove":
            l.remove(int(e[0]))
        elif cmd == "append":
            l.append(int(e[0]))
        elif cmd == "sort":
            l.sort()
        elif cmd == "pop":
            l.pop()
        elif cmd == "reverse":
            l.reverse()
```

By making this modification, the code will be compatible with both the latest and older versions of Python.

Please note that this code assumes valid inputs and does not include error handling or validation.
