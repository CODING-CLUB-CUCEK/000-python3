## Explanation

```python
from itertools import permutations
```
This line imports the `permutations` function from the `itertools` module. The `permutations` function is a powerful tool that generates all possible permutations of elements from an iterable.

```python
def print_permutations(s, k):
    # Generate permutations
    perms = permutations(s, k)
    
    # Sort permutations lexicographically
    sorted_perms = sorted(perms)
    
    # Print permutations
    for perm in sorted_perms:
        print(''.join(perm))
```
This defines the `print_permutations` function that takes two parameters: `s` (the input string) and `k` (the size of permutations to generate). 

Inside the function:
- The `permutations(s, k)` function generates all possible permutations of size `k` from the input string `s` and returns an iterator that produces tuples of characters representing the permutations. These permutations include all possible arrangements of characters of length `k` from the given string.
- The `sorted(perms)` line sorts the permutations lexicographically. By sorting the permutations, they are printed in a sorted order.
- The `for` loop iterates over the sorted permutations and prints each one. The `''.join(perm)` joins the characters of each tuple (`perm`) into a single string, which is then printed.

```python
input_str = input()
string, k = input_str.split()
```
This code reads the input from a single line. The `input()` function reads a line of input from the user. The `split()` method splits the input line at spaces and returns a list of substrings. The first substring is assigned to the variable `string`, and the second substring is assigned to the variable `k`.

```python
print_permutations(string, int(k))
```
This line calls the `print_permutations` function, passing `string` and `k` as arguments. It generates and prints all possible permutations of size `k` from the string `s` (specified by `string`) in lexicographic sorted order.

Overall, the code reads the input string `s` and the integer value `k` from a single line, generates all possible permutations of size `k` from `s`, sorts them lexicographically, and then prints them one by one.
