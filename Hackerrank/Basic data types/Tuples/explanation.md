The code snippet is designed to solve the following problem:

Given an integer, n, as the first input, and n space-separated integers as the second input, the code creates a tuple, t, containing those n integers. Then it computes and prints the hash value of the tuple, t.

# Explanation

- The `if __name__ == '__main__':` block ensures that the following code is only executed when the script is run directly, not when it is imported as a module.

- The first line `n = int(input())` prompts the user to enter an integer value for n and assigns it to the variable `n`.

- The second line `integer_list = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` prompts the user to enter n space-separated integers. It uses `input().split()` to split the input string at whitespace, `map(int, ...)` to convert each substring to an integer, and `tuple(...)` to convert the resulting sequence of integers into a tuple. The tuple is assigned to the variable `integer_list`.

- Finally, the last line `print(hash(integer_list))` computes the hash value of the tuple `integer_list` using the `hash()` function, and prints the result.
