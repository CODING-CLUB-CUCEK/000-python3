## List Comprehensions Example

This is an example code snippet that demonstrates the usage of list comprehensions in Python. The code generates a list of all possible coordinates on a 3D grid with given dimensions, while excluding coordinates whose sum of values matches a given threshold.

### Code Example

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = int(input())
    y = int(input())
    z = int(input())
    n = int(input())

    # Using list comprehensions to generate the coordinates
    coordinates = [[i, j, k] for i in range(x + 1) for j in range(y + 1) for k in range(z + 1) if (i + j + k) != n]

    print(coordinates)
``` 

## Explanation
The code above showcases the concept of list comprehensions. List comprehensions are a concise way to create lists in Python by transforming or filtering an existing iterable.

In this example, we have four variables: x, y, z, and n, representing the dimensions of a cuboid and a threshold value, respectively.

The goal is to generate a list of all possible coordinates (i, j, k) on a 3D grid, where 0 <= i <= x, 0 <= j <= y, and 0 <= k <= z, while ensuring that the sum of i, j, and k is not equal to n.

The code achieves this using a list comprehension, which iterates over the ranges of x, y, and z and checks the condition (i + j + k) != n. The resulting coordinates that satisfy the condition are collected in the coordinates list.

Finally, the coordinates list is printed, displaying all the possible coordinates on the 3D grid that meet the given conditions.
