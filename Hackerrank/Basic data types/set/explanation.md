### Python Code Explanation

The given code defines a function named `average` that takes an array as input and calculates the average of the unique elements in the array. Here's a breakdown of the code:

```python
def average(array):
    array = set(array)              # Convert the array to a set to remove duplicate elements
    result = sum(array) / len(array) # Calculate the average by summing all elements and dividing by the number of elements
    result = round(result, 3)       # Round the result to 3 decimal places
    return result                   # Return the calculated average
```

The `average` function first converts the input array to a set using the `set()` function. This eliminates any duplicate elements, ensuring that only unique elements are considered in the average calculation.

Next, the function calculates the average by dividing the sum of all elements in the set by the number of elements. The `sum()` function is used to calculate the sum, and `len()` is used to get the length of the set.

Finally, the calculated average is rounded to 3 decimal places using the `round()` function, and the result is returned.

The code then checks if the script is being run directly (i.e., not imported as a module) by using the `__name__` variable. If the script is the main module, the following code block is executed:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())                 # Read an integer from the user, specifying the number of elements in the array
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read a space-separated list of integers from the user and convert it into a list of integers
    result = average(arr)            # Call the average function with the input array and store the result
    print(result)                    # Print the calculated average
```

In this block, the code first prompts the user to enter an integer `n`, representing the number of elements in the array. Then, it reads a space-separated list of integers from the user using `input()` and `split()`, and converts the input into a list of integers using the `map()` function and `int()` conversion.

The `average()` function is then called with the input array `arr`, and the returned average value is stored in the variable `result`. Finally, the calculated average is printed using the `print()` function.

Overall, this code calculates the average of unique elements in an array and prints the result.
